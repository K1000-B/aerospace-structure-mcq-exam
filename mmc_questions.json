      "choices": null,
      "answer": false,
      "explication": "Differential bending refers to different bending stiffness and curvature between adjacent structural elements, but buckling panels effectively lose most of their bending contribution. The statement mixes concepts and does not correctly define the phenomenon, so it is false."

      "choices": null,
      "answer": false,
      "explication": "The criterion to neglect shear deformability compares bending stiffness EI with shear stiffness GA through a term like EI/(k GA l^2), not EI/(l^2 EA). Using axial stiffness EA in this ratio is incorrect, so the statement is false."

      "answer": false,

      "explication": "In a pure axial stress state, σzz is the only non-zero normal stress and is directly related to εzz by σzz = E εzz for a linear elastic isotropic material. This is exactly the one-dimensional Hooke’s law, so it is correct for an axial stress state."

      "explication": "For thin-walled members, shear flow q is defined as shear force per unit length and is given by q = τ̄ t, where τ̄ is the average shear stress and t is the panel thickness. Hence it is the average shear stress multiplied by the thickness."

      "answer": "higher at the extremities",
      "explication": "In bonded joints, load transfer starts at the ends of the overlap, creating peak shear stresses near the extremities due to shear lag. Therefore the shear stress in the adhesive is higher at the extremities."

      "answer": "none of the above",
      "explication": "For an unconstrained structure under self-equilibrated loads, stresses and strains are still well-defined despite the presence of rigid body modes. None of the proposed answers correctly describes this situation, so “none of the above” is correct."

      "answer": false,

      ],
      "answer": "the flows equilibrating the load introduced by the rib",
      "explication": "The rib introduces loads into the surrounding structure, and the shear flows in the skins and spars must equilibrate the loads transmitted by the rib. Therefore, they are the flows equilibrating the load introduced by the rib."

      "answer": "is used to impose the equilibrium",
      "explication": "The Principle of Virtual Work states that the virtual work of internal forces equals the virtual work of external forces for all admissible virtual displacements, which enforces equilibrium. Compatibility and essential boundary conditions are built into the choice of virtual displacements, so its main role is to impose equilibrium."

      "answer": "always",
      "explication": "If the members are slender, their response is governed primarily by axial force, bending and shear, which beam elements are designed to capture. Therefore a system of slender beams can in principle always be modeled using beam finite elements."

      "explication": "Plane strain assumes that the axial strain component along the out-of-plane direction is zero (for example εzz = 0), which means no axial deformation in that direction. For a slender body constrained in that way, the axial deformation is null, so the statement is true."

      "choices": null,
      "answer": false,
      "explication": "Plane strain assumes that one strain component (for example εzz) is zero, but all three normal stresses may be nonzero due to Poisson effects. Thus, it does not imply that any stress component is null, so the statement is false."

      "question": "The essential boundary conditions are satisfied in a weak sense by the Principle of Virtual Work.",
      "choices": null,
      "answer": false,
      "explication": "In the standard virtual work formulation, essential boundary conditions (displacements) are enforced directly on the trial and virtual displacement fields (strongly), while natural boundary conditions (tractions) enter in weak form. Therefore, the statement claiming that essential conditions are satisfied in a weak sense is false."

      "choices": null,
      "answer": false,
      "explication": "In semi-monocoque theory, axial stresses in panels arise mainly from axial and bending resultants distributed according to stiffness, not from the axial derivative of shear stress. That relation is not a correct constitutive or equilibrium equation, so the statement is false."

      ],
      "answer": "higher at the extremities",
      "explication": "As in other bonded joints, the load transfer in glued connections produces stress peaks at the edges of the overlap where the load enters the adhesive. Thus, the shear stress transmitted by a glued connection is higher at the extremities."

      "explication": "Bearing stress is the local compressive contact stress between a fastener (such as a rivet) and the surrounding hole. It is therefore directly associated with riveted connections, not with glued joints or shell through-thickness shear."
